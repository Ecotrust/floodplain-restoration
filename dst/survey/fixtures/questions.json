Confluences with large tributaries or changes in sediment materials may also be used to delineate reaches (Skidmore et al. 2011). \\r\\n\\r\\nA relevant \\u201creach scale\\u201d may already be determined for your project area, based on river assessments or known conditions in the area. Consult available watershed assessments or other relevant documents to determine whether a reach has already been determined for your property or project site.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor projects intended to provide or enhance habitat for migratory or anadromous fish, consider whether the site will be accessible to the species following restoration. Are there dams or other impediments beyond the site that will limit access to the site regardless of restoration?",
